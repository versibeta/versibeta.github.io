Let me tell you something.
Today is my birthday.
And not only that, but a new stage of my life begins today.
I will no longer live day by day.
Instead, I will focus on living in the present to shape a promising future.
It's time to wake up, to recognize that I can indeed grow, that it's never too late, and that being alive and healthy gives me the opportunity to always move forward.
No more wasting this opportunity.
I know I can because I believe in myself.
The fact that I'm celebrating today is the definitive proof that I am destined for great things.
I won't listen to anything that doesn't fill my heart or my life with goals to achieve.
I won't allow anyone to set me back.
And instead of seeing darkness, I will always seek the light.
Because that's what radiates from my being and where I must always advance.
I will make the most of every second as I have the most beautiful gift, which is being alive.
Happy birthday to me.
Because I love and will always surpass myself.
In a year, I will know that everything was worth it and more.
Happy birthday, buddy.
I love myself.

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
