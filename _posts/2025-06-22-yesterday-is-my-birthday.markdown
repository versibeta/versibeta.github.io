Free hosting with GitHub Pages
Sick of dealing with hosting companies? GitHub Pages is powered by Jekyll, so you can easily deploy your site using GitHub for free—custom domain name and all.

But the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
